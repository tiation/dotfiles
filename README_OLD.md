## Features

- Fully customizable installation depending on OS
- The [installer](scripts/) is seperated from configs and install scripts
- A [dotfiles manager](bin/dotfiles/main.sh) for post-install maintenance
- Has post-install scripts for configuring `git`, `ssh` and `gpg`
- Requires git commands for syncing without fancy dotfile managers

## Uses

- Supports `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`  with `starship` shell prompt

## Installation
### MacOS 12.0 Monterey (and above)

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -LsS https://raw.github.com/codechenx/dotfiles/main/scripts/setup.sh)"
```

### Pop!_OS
```bash
bash -c "$(wget --no-cache -qO - https://raw.github.com/codechenx/dotfiles/main/scripts/setup.sh)"
```
## Using Dotfiles

After installing the dotfiles, you can pretty much start using these configurations right away.

- All changes to configuration files will be recognized by git as modified within dotfiles folder except for the config files created with `.local` suffix.
- You can use `dotfiles` command for dotfile manager script for running maintenance commands.
## Credits

This dotfiles repository is a heavily ~~knocked-off~~ inspired version of beautiful [Cătălin’s dotfiles](https://github.com/alrra/dotfiles). You should probably check it out!

I have modified this dotfiles with my own taste of config files and added a bunch of helpers and utilities to install packages, extensions etc. from different sources that I trust. I tried to seperate installation system and OS-spesific configurations as much as I can, so it would be easier to implement new OS setups which I might do later.
